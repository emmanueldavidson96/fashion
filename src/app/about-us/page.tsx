                    Our primary market is emerging African heritage designers and SMEs who are typically ignored by the major fashion events and, if not, are tokenised. 
                    </p>
                    <p className='text-white leading-8 text-sm lg:text-lg lg:leading-10'>
                    At AFWN, we make sure our designers are afforded the same promotional opportunities, access to buyers and showcased in a world-class venue. We support and nurture the sustainable design and apparel manufacturing industry. Our goal is to make African-inspired fashion, not only a high-street staple but also a force to rival established fashion houses. 
                    </p>
                    <p className='text-white leading-8 text-sm lg:text-lg lg:leading-10'>
                    Similarly, we make sure 90% of our workforce is made up of POC, fashion students and marginalised communities, giving the experience of working for a major fashion showcasing event.
