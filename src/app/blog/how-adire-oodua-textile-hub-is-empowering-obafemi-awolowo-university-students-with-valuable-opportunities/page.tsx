                    These passionate students expressed their eagerness to immerse themselves in the art of Adire-making, 
                    learning both the creative processes and the business acumen behind African textiles. 
                    Their interest underscores a growing movement among young Nigerians to connect with their cultural 
                    heritage—not just in theory but through hands-on experience.
