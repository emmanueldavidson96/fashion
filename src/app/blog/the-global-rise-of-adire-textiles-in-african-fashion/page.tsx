                    <p className='text-black text-base'>In the world of African fashion, Adire textiles have emerged as a cultural icon and a 
                    symbol of heritage, creativity, and innovation. Originating from Nigeria, Adire—which means “tied and dyed” in Yoruba—is a 
                    centuries-old textile art that continues to captivate global audiences. Its bold patterns, vibrant colors, and 
                    intricate designs have transformed it from a 
                    traditional craft into a sought-after material in modern fashion.</p>
                    <h2 className='text-lg font-semibold text-black'>A Brief History of Adire</h2>
                    <p className='text-black text-base'>
                    Adire textiles have their roots in Southwestern Nigeria, where the Yoruba people pioneered this unique form of resist-dyeing. 
                    Traditionally, artisans used raffia or cassava paste to create intricate designs on cotton fabrics, 
                    which were then dyed in natural indigo baths. 
                    These textiles were often worn during ceremonies and were regarded as a symbol of status and cultural identity.
                    </p>
                    <p className='text-black text-base'>
                    Over time, the craft evolved, incorporating modern techniques and synthetic dyes to create more diverse patterns and colors. 
                    Despite these advancements, the essence of Adire—its ability to tell stories through patterns—remains intact.
